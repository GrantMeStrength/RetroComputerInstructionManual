# IMSAI shortcuts

**Start up in configuration mode**

The IMSAI 8080 replica has a special start-up mode for configuring ROMs and other settings (e.g. Z80 or 8080). To enter this mode:

* Connect the power supply, but turn the **PWR** switch to **OFF**.
* Hold the **EXAMINE** toggle up, and keep holding.
* Turn the **PWR** switch to **ON**, still holding **EXAMINE**.
* Take a breath, and then release the **EXAMINE** button

The LEDs should be flashing.

**CRT Full-screen Mode**

The Desktop UI CRT view has a full-screen mode. To exit this mode, press ALT and ESCAPE.

On some systems, this key combination is intercepted by the OS and so nothing will happen. You'll need to reload the Desktop UI in this case.

**Ctrl-C when changing disks**

If you swap out disks, you must press Ctrl-C before acccessing them.
