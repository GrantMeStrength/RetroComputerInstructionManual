How would you save such a carefully entered piece of software? Well, unless you added some extra hardware, you couldn't save it. If you ever turned the computer off, the program would be lost forever.

Storage systems were therefore high on every computer owner's list. The cheapest was the humble cassette tape. Many expansion cards included support for saving and loading memory to tape as audio tones.

Floppy disks were considerably more convenient (but expensive), and eventually hard drives came along with literally megabytes of storage. 

Early adaptors may have used paper tape to store programs too - the first version of Microsoft BASIC was sold on paper tape. To load it, you needed a tape reader - a loud and expensive machine.
