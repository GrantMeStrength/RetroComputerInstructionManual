# Introduction

You've built your retro computer kit.

It sits there, with its LEDs blinking and switches beckoning. Your almost thinking of ordering another kit, because putting this one together was so much fun.

But wait! Building it was only half the adventure - now you get to use it!

**But really, can it do anything?**

Yes! Here's a short list of things you can do with your Altair or IMSAI kit.

* Learning about binary, octal and hexidecimal numbering systems. 
* Learn assembly language programming.
* Play some classic games (Read "Ready Player One?") that are actually good, and without social media notifications distracting you.
* Learn how to use one of the earliest operating systems: CP/M. Download and try literally thousands of applications.
* Solve some gnarly problems as you set up serial terminals, mount virtual disk drives, and play with bit rates and device ports.
* Write software in assembler, BASIC, C, FORTH, Algol and languages and turn your computer into a clock or other monitoring system, so while it sits on your shelf it can do something.
* Learn about and build electronics that interface with the computer, and interface it with the modern world of networks and internets.
* Learn about computer history, and create something your kid can bring to a science fair.

**Learning** is a large part of it, and the skills you learn will be applicable to even today's computer challenges - albeit in a simpler, kinder way. It's also fun, and a lot easier and cheaper than it was when this stuff was new, back in 1975.
